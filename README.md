# What's this?

This is an example of a simple Golang HTTP API that I used to get to know more about how Golang works. The structure of this project is deeply inspired by NestJS (a framework for NodeJS) where each layer has its own responsibility, for example, the repository layer is responsible for speaking with the database, the service layer is responsible for business logic, and the controller layer forwards user requests to the related service layers.

**This is not a production-ready project that you have to imitate, which solely has a role for training and college assignments.**
